// Write a program to calculate the compound interest.
// Inputs: starting amount, the number of years to invest, the interest rate, and the number of periods per year to compound.
// Process: principal_amount * pow(1 + (interest_rate/times_compounded_per_year), times_compounded_per_year * invested_years)
// Output: $1500 invested at 4.3% for 6 years compounded 4 times per year is $1938.84.
